Simple app to perform CRUD operations on CSV datasets (read, edit in place, create new rows at the chosen index, delete rows after marking)

Made in Flet from scratch in 1 week without prior knowledge.

Not finished other expected functionalities (changed to another framework that allowed interactive plots, Streamlit)
